# About Us

Law enforcement institutions in the United States are not subject to the same checks and balances as regular citizens. 
Practices such as qualified immunity and civil asset forfeiture have led to abuses of power by law enforcement agencies, including violence against citizens. 
Our mission is to connect civilians who have been harassed, abused, or detained by law enforcement with  legal representation who specialize in civil rights. 

Additionally, we want to provide those who have suffered injustice and mistreatment with a singular resource to contact their local, state, and national representatives in order to enact change, and hold officers, agencies, and overseeing bodies accountable.
