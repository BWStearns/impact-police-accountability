Re: **(issue described)**
 
On **(date)**, I **(observed, experienced)** a **(breach of social justice)** at **(location and other important details)**.
 
Details of the experience **(e.g. unlawful arrest or brutality; injuries sustained; evidence of similar misconduct - a "pattern or practice" of misconduct builds a stronger case)** including details of officers involved if applicable. This event was an example of **(kind of misconduct covered by law: excessive force, sexual assault, intentional false arrests, theft, intentional fabrication of evidence resulting in a loss of liberty to another, unlawful stops, searches or arrests.)**. I believe this event occurred on the basis of my **(race, color, national origin, sex, religion, disability, other protected class. NOTE: law enforcement misconduct law does not require that any racial, religious, or other discriminatory motive existed.)**. 
 
To resolve the problem, I would appreciate your **(state the specific action you want: governmental action, orders to end the misconduct, changes in the agency's policies and procedures that resulted in or allowed the misconduct, fines, or imprisonment)**. Enclosed are copies **(do not send originals)** of my records **(include video, testimonies)**.
